# cc3-simple-2d-shadow
CocosCreator 3.X module that allows you to create simple shadow effect of 2d objects easily

To achieve this, simply add a "ShadowOwner" component to the node of the object that should cast the shadow and adjust the base shape of this object in the "PolygonCollider2D" required component.

Please note that this module will help you draw the shadows of objects of simple shapes. For example: cube, parallelogram, cylinder and so on. For complex asymmetric shapes, this module is hardly suitable.
